# Security

## What the browser tool does with your data

- The page makes no network requests of any kind: no fetch, XHR, WebSocket, beacons or analytics. The only external resource is the Google Fonts stylesheet.
- No data leaves the browser. Job inputs you type or load from a file are processed in memory and are never uploaded or stored.
- Files are read with the browser's FileReader from a file you pick. Files over 5 MB or 50,000 rows are refused.
- localStorage holds one UI convenience only (which tab was open last). It never holds job data.
- The page uses no eval, no `new Function`, and no inline event handlers. User-supplied text is inserted with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`.
- The GitHub Pages build (`docs/index.html`) adds a Content-Security-Policy meta tag with `connect-src 'none'`.

## Python library

The library has no runtime dependencies, makes no network calls, and uses no pickle, eval or shell calls. The CLI reads only the file path you pass it.

## Reporting a problem

Open a GitHub issue with the label `security`, or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository if the issue should not be public. Include the steps to reproduce and the browser or Python version.
